"""Based on the authors examples of Trump and vaccines, the author is talking about sympathy and compassion, both of which require of us to take sides.""

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",0,not toxic

And Captain Crayon's popularity is plummeting Cassandra. He was only at 53% in late June and likely far below that now due to the Khadr decision. Remember he was once as high as 72% until Canadians finally realized his high level of incompetence is permanent and irreversible regardless of how much time he's given to learn the ropes.

Scheer (46%) isn't far off from Ambrose's (51%) numbers considering the limited amount of time he's been in the spotlight",0,not toxic

"I absolutely agree we as a Church should address the issue of racism in this country, in my native country, and everywhere else.

In my opinion, if the removal of statues is not accompanied by a systemic effort to uproot racist ideas and attitudes, we won't have accomplished anything. So perhaps the removals should come at the end of a process, as a sort of culmination of a national effort to excise a cancer, and their presence till then should serve as a reminder of what remains to be done.

It was a normal day, but sunny as you mention.  I don't tend to bottle things up, as may be obvious and I'm not even slightly entitled; more of a Calvinist, actually.

Similarly, I don't impose on others' rights of way.  That means i don't blast through a gaggle of peds crossing the street lawfully (at a crossing, the only place it's actually legal for a ped to set foot on a roadway), run through a red like it's not there, go the wrong way up a road, change my positioning in a lane in rush hour without knowing what's beside/behind me, etc.  But i don't tolerate people imposing their will on my rights without saying something about it.

Mr. Taylor has forgotten that the Dems had open discussions with the Re-pubics and asked them for input.

As it was, their obstruction caused Obama to water the ACA down a bit in order to demonstrate some appeasement to the Re-pubics and their constituents (BTW: that turned out to be a big mistake).
If you remember, Dan, the Dems started working on healthcare in February 2009 and it was not signed into law until March 23, 2010 (more than a year later). Also, they tried for nearly a year to get honest participation from the Re-pubics ... to no avail.

The quote:  The minister of this sacrament is the priest, to whom it belongs to baptize, by reason of his office. In case of necessity, however, not only a priest or deacon, but even a layman or woman, nay, even a pagan or heretic can baptize, provided he observes the form used by the Church, and intends to perform what the Church performs.

"What strikes me as most significant is that water drawn from the ""high-level aquifer"" is already brackish and approaching the point of not being drinkable.  That most likely indicates that the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater lens under Lanai is relatively small and thin -- probably an ongoing natural condition (since Lanai sits somewhat in Maui's ""rain shadow"") and partly due to historic long-term depletion for agriculture.

It's an obvious fact of nature that one can't continue drawing more fresh water from this lens than it receives from natural ""recharging"" processes, without depleting it.  Excess withdrawal causes the ""mixing zone"" of brackish water to rise upward, and eventually freshwater wells start turning brackish.

Vaping has spread quickly through word of mouth and Facebook, but the bill would make it a criminal offense to say that it's safer and more pleasant than smoking. They say that they want to make sure that Canadian regulations reflect science, but ignore much of the international research showing that vaping is vastly safer than smoking to both the individual and his/her surroundings and that vaping is not proving to be a gateway to tobacco.

"Current Ontario electricity rates range from about 14.7 cents/kWh off-peak to 21.7 cents/kWh on-peak, so the prices you quote are actually $8.82 to $13.02 for a full 60kWh charge, maybe a couple dollars more when you factor in efficiency losses in charging.

Remember you pay for delivery, regulatory fees and taxes in addition to the straight-up electricity rate.

Still a cheaper energy source than a comparable gas powered car, particularly for high-performance vehicles, but it will take a lot of driving to make up for the higher up-front cost.  A Chevy Bolt, for example, will set you back almost $20,000 more than a similar sized and equipped Chevy Sonic (before subsidies), so even if all charging is done off-peak you're still looking at 275,000km+ before the cheaper fuel cost offsets the higher upfront cost.

If, and it's a big if, the dress code was put in place because the intent of the dress code was to keep a specific class or demographic group, who is protected under the 14th Amendment, out of the establishment, then that's a different story. Either way, if the APD used the language, as the article purports, and it was the officers' intent to remove him based on his ethnic, religious, etc... status, then it could be an interesting case. If the proprietor actually did ask the officers to remove him, and based their rationale on his dress code alone, then they were likely performing a trespass removal, under the color of law, and aren't liable for those actions.

Newsflash for you:  the overriding reason the Assault Weapons Ban was allowed to sunset after ten years was because there was no persuasive evidence that it worked.  

Quite simply (from Wikipedia.org) :

""The Task Force on Community Preventive Services, an independent, non-federal task force, examined an assortment of firearms laws, including the AWB, and found 'insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws reviewed for preventing violence'.""

It goes without saying this is very old news. 

Now granted, if by reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban your intent is to keep bureaucrats employed and to support the passage or continuation laws that don't work, that's one thing, but by all means be explicit about it.  Just don't claim your intent is to prevent violent crime.  That would be disingenuous, if not an outright falsehood.

Mexicans want a change of government and the NAFTA stance of the US fuels the left wing populist cause making the negotiating options of the current government increasingly narrow.

They have a right to make their statements. They did this two years ago. Their pastor and bishop did not see it their way. There is a canonical procedure they can follow, although with the picayune complaints I cannot imagine them getting what they apparently wish.

Your argument about ""convincingness"" doesn't convince me. It seems more like splitting hairs.

If the desire to live convinces them to raise their hands, wouldn't they go about with their hands raised during that portion of their lives when they desired to live? Probably (obviously?) not. The presence of the gun is the convincing catalyst that makes the desire to live come to the forefront of attention.
As to convincing criteria, are you saying it is subjective? I'd agree with that. Some people are more easily convinced by a given argument than others who are more skeptical.

"And yet, according to an article in today's New York Times,

 ""On a range of issues, Mr. Trump seems to be taking a page from the Sanders playbook, expressing a willingness to increase the minimum wage, suggesting that the wealthy may pay higher taxes than under his original proposal, attacking Mrs. Clinton from the left on national security and Wall Street, and making clear that his opposition to free trade will be a centerpiece of his general election campaign.

As Mr. Trump lays the groundwork for his likely showdown with Mrs. Clinton, he is staking out a series of populist positions that could help him woo working-class Democrats in November. But in doing so, he is exacerbating the trepidation some Republicans already feel about his candidacy at a moment when the party typically rallies to its nominee.""

But when your political beliefs take on the characteristics of religious values, and you start using the Bible to support those values, the distinction is pretty tough to see and maintain. 

This dangerous proclivity is conservative in the sense that political powers tend to stamp out religion as a source of legitimate authority and/or invoke religious symbols to reinforce their values. Those who seek radical transformation sound quite liberal until they have succeeded. Then they become quite repressive and conservative when the roots and fruits of what they have planted are threatened.

I see the article more about how one approaches rules rather than their source or of questioning them. For example, does the ""legitimate authority"" own them, as in umpire or referee. One could go a bit further with the more recent introduction of ""challenges"" and ""replays"" that suggest that ""arbiters"" of rules and authorities are indeed accountable - under certain conditions, of course .

Your point regarding the need to be aware of the costs and consequences of the First World War is valid. However, you generalize to the point of absurdity when you make a statement such as ""that Germany was immediately determined to wage a war of revenge (WWII)."" 

What is ignored is twenty years of German domestic politics and developments in international affairs, all of which could have produced a much different outcome. Decisions made in Berlin, London, Paris, Moscow, Washington, Rome, and all the other major seats of power - including Geneva, home of the League of Nations , and New York, centre of world finances - all had a bearing on how the world shaped itself after the treaties were concluded in 1919.

Swedish welfare ghettos - social strains - $4-billion a year on settling new refugees

""Sweden’s fantasy is that if you socialize the children of immigrants and refugees correctly, they’ll grow up to be just like native Swedes. But it hasn’t worked out that way. Much of the second generation lives in nice Swedish welfare ghettos. ""

""The social strains – white flight, a general decline in trust – are growing worse. The immigrant-heavy city of Malmo ... is an economic and social basket case.""

""Sweden’s generosity costs a fortune, at a time when economic growth is stagnant. The country now spends about $4-billion a year on settling new refugees – up from $1-billion a few years ago, Mr. Sanandaji (himself an immigrant, a Kurdish-Swedish economist) said.

Mainstream media has failed (hello CBC, Toronto Star, Globe and Mail) to assure viewers they are receiving reporting that aspires to be balanced and objective.

Look, no kidding, when viewers realize, from everyday observations, the big media outlets are not giving straight goods, they will naturally seek alternative (often dubious) information sources. 

Examples of media bias?

1. Selectively reporting protests. I favour liberal abortion access for Canada, but city drivers know anti-abortion activists hold periodic protests. The media ignore them - yet activists from Black Lives Matter (and various minority/gender groups) get covered all the time. Why so SELECTIVE?

Henry VIII beheaded two of his wives, Anne Boleyn (on trumped-up charges) and Catherine Howard (on quite legitimate charges -- adultery by the queen was treason under the statute). Of the others, two were divorced (one for non-consumation), one died in childbirth and the sixth outlived him.

Henry actually had solid grounds for an annulment. His father, Henry VII, arranged a marriage between his eldest son, Arthur, and Catherine of Aragon. A few months afterwards, Arthur died. The king wanted to keep the Catherine's dowry (over a million in today's currency, which would have had to be repaid out of the Privy Purse). So he decided to marry his second son, Henry, to Catherine. There was a problem: Under Church marriage law, one cannot marry one's deceased spouse's sibling.",0,not toxic

The SB21 production tax on “new” oil at this PTV is reduced another $5 per barrel to a production tax of only 9 percent. In addition, the Gross Value Reduction of 20 percent applied before calculating the production tax on “new oil” reduces the production tax to only $1 per barrel or 2 percent.""

Because Quebec and Atlantic Canada have easy access to oil by sea, they were exempted from the NOP and continued to buy oil in international markets.  The expense of an oil pipeline east was considered foolish.

The spike in global oil prices in the early 70s then gave rise to the NEP, when government wanted to pay Alberta less than market prices to help even out the price shock.

Great, you have been studying the idea for 30 years. Then you should be able to explain this since you understand it, as I would love to.
My and most peoples question will be, Who pays for it ?
Where does all of this magic ""free money"" come from ? 
I mean, personally i think it would be an awesome thing to know that people have their basic needs met. I run a non profit org and work with the homeless daily. To know or think that with this we could eliminate most homelessness once and for all ? freakin awesome!  It would free up so many other resources to focus on bigger and better things, higher education, cures for diseases, real renewable energy.
But even as a non profit org, we get money one of 2 basic ways.  1) or we earn it (which is most of our money) or 2) someone gives us some - someone else earned it.  We have no governemtn grants, those are all tax dollars.

"""After the federal government introduced Bill C-56 in late June that would restrict how long inmates can be placed in solitary confinement...""

That statement is incorrect. Bill C-56 does NOT restrict how long a prisoner may be kept in solitary confinement. This includes younger offenders and prisoners with mental health issues. Bill C-56 simply requires that the warden who sends the prisoner to solitary confinement shall file a report on the matter after 15 days. After that, there's no limit to the amount of time a prisoner may be kept in isolation.

"The author has shown us good reason to use collective bargaining, it works to balance the huge imbalance of power between ownership and any single employee.    But private unions turned to the government and found a friendly hand, at least part of the time.   Instead of negotiation for profit share, unions negotiate with a government institution, but not private ownership.   The federal government abandoned it's support mechanism for unions, and unions abandoned the workers in low wages that needed their support in favor of trying to find new 'opportunities' to leverage concessions out of large corporate entities, and of course Government contracting.

Worse Unions chased the money the could find in higher paying jobs that did provide a good standard of living, and forgot about organizing those who aren't even earning the deeply devalued current minimum wage.

"Richard Phillips wrote, in response to my suggestion that a state income tax would have the advantage of getting revenue from those who live out of state but work here, ""The courts already ruled against taxing out of state residents.""

This is completely wrong. There are many people who live in one state and work in another. If both states have an income tax, then taxes are paid to both states—to simplify somewhat, the state where the individual works but doesn't live is entitled to tax on only the income earned in that state, while the state of residence is entitled to tax on all income earned, but with a credit for income tax paid to other states.

Yes, it can get complicated, but it's a pretty common situation (just look at how many people live in New Jersey or Connecticut but work in New York City, for one example). There is no basis to a claim that out of state residents wouldn't be subject to income taxes here.",0,not toxic

And we’re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river.”

Zinke’s answer to that problem was similar to Bannon treating the members of the Freedom Caucus like a child who can be ordered to comply with your wishes.


Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed Tuesday that the U.S. build its border wall on Mexico’s side of the border.

The difference between a statue erected to celebrate a person for treason against his country and historical landmarks which contain artifacts of slavery as it existed before 1861, should be self evident.  In fact, Monticello was built in 1772, before there was a Declaration of Independence, Constitution or United States.  And, the heroes of the revolution did not fight to specifically to preserve the rights to own others.  In fact, the Revolutionary war can be seen as a step in a social evolution that led to the freedom of slaves.  (Read the history of battles in Congress to end it).

The Iraq War itself is a disgrace, a blot on the national character as bad as anything the US has ever done, no matter how well, or badly, individual soldiers performed their duty. We will never see the end of its ramifications. 

Maybe the worst is the betrayal of America's young soldiers' fervent commitment to duty, fraternity and the nation. All of that was wasted, at best. At worst, they were betrayed for short term political advantage and corporate profits.

At Stanford in 1959, Kesey volunteered to take part in a CIA-financed study named Project MKULTRA.

Kesey wrote many detailed accounts of his experiences with these drugs, both during the Project MKULTRA study and in the years of private experimentation that followed.

What he has said here is for  ""WHAT HAPPENED.""  It didn't just HAPPEN.  HE DID IT!  I would be saying I'm sorry for WHAT i DID!  When a person uses the word ""happen"" they aren't taking responsibility for what they did. It's as if the event was outside of himself. 

The reasoning follows with another example.  

In AA I hear people introduce themselves as ""my name is....."" and then saying the word ""alcoholic.""  Not ""I am an alcoholic or I am addicted to alcohol"".   A person that says just ""alcoholic"" is not claiming this disease as their own.  They are just saying a word.

The more recent claims address violent weather, droughts, and other things that have much less evidence associated with them.  Regarding the holocaust, of course the number killed matters.  If it was 200, it would be nothing compared to the Democratic President's war crime of killing hundreds of thousands of non-combatant Japanese via nuclear fire or the comparable numbers of non-combatants killed in the saturation bombing of German cities.  There are many atrocities Mr. Scott.  But the majority cast a blind eye to those outside the popular point of view.  I've read that US support for the Syria rebel killers has killed a hundred thousand or more and made refugees out of million more.  A democrat liberal (who loves everybody and is good) did that.

2) They incorrectly include papers that are irrelevant to the question in the denominator, making the fraction arbitrarily small.  Cook correctly culled out ""no position"" papers.
3) They ignore a theorem that the sum of probabilities of all outcomes in sample space must = 1.  Cook satisfied that theorem.

Nuclear plants used to have a similar ratio, but the USA government mandated them to have a second set of steam handling equipment installed to provide close to continuous operation.

The high ratio of down time for steam processing generators provided Enron and TransAlta with phoney excuses for shutting down plants during peak demand periods. They are supposed to schedule the planned maintenance for off peak hours.

The Senate never took a vote to adopt a rule to delay consideration of a nominee until after the election (hence there is no Biden rule).

Because certain nobles feared that the chancellor was acquiring too much power, the courts of law and equity were ultimately combined.  ""Epikeia"" is a sort of ecclesiastical counterpart in the Eastern Churches, which do NOT apply the ""divine laws"" of marriage with Western harshness.",0,not toxic

Harrison, who was not registered as a guest, entered the hotel and began writing on a wall. When contacted by hotel security, Harrison became agitated and started shouting at the front desk staff. Harrison said two Fairbanks City Council members were going to pay for a room for him to stay in. Hotel staff asked Harrison to leave and he began shouting that the council members were demons who were sent to kill him, according to the charges. Harrison opened a half door and let himself behind the front desk, then menaced the staff with a pen. He entered an office, barricaded the door with filing cabinets and discharged a fire extinguisher in the room.

Confronting hatred leads to, obviously, confrontation. Confrontation leads to conflict. Conflict lends itself to violence, which extremists on both sides embrace.

 Trying to contain or confront expressions of exclusion and hate also validates them.  So don't go there. It's always an option to ignore hateful messages. Instead, see the human behind the words.

The real way to make money is to manage your own psychological energy.  I don't really think you need to be any more financially sophisticated than to create a few buckets to dump your money into.  Your personal home is one bucket best left full.  By leaving your personal home bucket full you can free up some psychological energy to focus on other investment buckets without concern for your or your family's material well-being.  Risk everything in your other investment buckets, not the one where your family lives.  That should be a last resort only in my opinion regardless of your risk tolerance.",0,not toxic

A former campaign staffer for Ronald Reagan who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, Pizzella was once employed by the viscerally anti-union National Right to Work Committee and later joined the firm that scandal-plagued lobbyist Jack Abramoff was associated with before his 2006 conviction on federal charges that included attempted bribery.",1,toxic

One extra-territorial person using spoofing technology does not a rise in U.S. anti-Jewish sentiment make. OTOH, NYPD’s evidence is not inconsistent with the thesis that this rash of threat calls is foreign, state-sponsored terrorism. Stahl, Sr., asks “Which state?” and suggests Israel has the means, motive, and opportunity.

The community center threats have been reported since late January, after Trump’s inauguration. I can’t think of a more existential threat to Israel than an isolationist, nationalist, America-First President who wants to cut foreign aid.

This whole inane protest is based upon a foundation of lies, beginning with Mr. “hands up, don’t shoot” himself, Michael Brown.

While I have no doubt that the players do not think of it in this way, they are essentially protesting for the right of violent criminals to resist and/or assault police officers without consequence.  Nearly every recent example that has undergirded the “Black Lives Matter” agenda has involved a completely justifiable police shooting.  In only one example that I can think of, the one involving the man on the street in New York City who was suffocated, was there any reasonable question about the actions of the officers involved.  Also frequently ignored is the fact that in some of these cases the “evil” officers were themselves black.",1,toxic

In 1971 when I was standing in Atigun Pass before a road was built thru the pass, silently alone with the wind in my ears, I knew the thundering stampede yet to arrive was focused on CRUDE without a broad education in energy architecture.

CRUDE is a messy goop stuck halfway between COAL & METHANE.

IMHO:  CRUDE has less value than properly processed COALwater [LRCWF].

Wasting our gas to produce CRUDE is like wasting all the gold&copper to produce the molybdenum in a big metalliferous porphyry.

"That's contradicted by the facts. First of all, Democrats have acknowledged the past and the party evolved to the anti-racist side, which prompted southern racists who used to constitute the Solid South for the party to migrate to the GOP, where the South now pretty much votes solidly for Republicans due to the GOP's adoption of the racist polices the Democrats used to push.

You reference to ""Trump the man rather than Trump the President"" is wholly illogical. The very problem with ""Trump the President"" is he is, in fact, ""Trump the Man.""  As I have often suggested, IMO, Trump the Man, as reflected in every facet of his life, meets the qualifications of a sociopath.  He is now President and, guess what, his actions continue to be consistent with those of Trump the (sociopathic) Man.  It would be foolish to expect anything else.

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say ""Islam"" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.

"You're correct that much of the  press information is heavily ""America"" biased.  There isn't a lot of info presenting the ""other side"" of the situation, because that largely goes against the grain of the flag waving here.  After talking to several people who have close ties to Iran, I discovered that their government is accepted largely to protect them from us.  Considering what we've done over there, I can easily see why they feel that way.  Most Americans think it's some religious ideology as the basis for their dislike of America, when in reality it's a response to our behavior there.

But, the info does exist, especially nowadays.  And, stepping back and going through history while piecing that together with our behavior and the situation, the truth will be apparent.  Trouble is, to truly understand the truth, one has to drop their guard and be willing to be wrong.

"Liberals are a curse on Canadian society.

They are corrupt, arrogant, intransigent, and unbelievably stupid,-- like termites, devouring and destroying the fabric first of Ontario and now all of Canada, and the very structures holding our society together.

And just like termites, they infested an antiquated English colonial system of government, with no protections or firewalls against these repulsive, ugly, sneak-thieves.

Truly Kathleen Wynne is the face of Liberalism in Ontario, with a convergence between the way she/it looks, and the crooked way she/it acts. The same applies to the acne-scarred bipolar leading Canada into the abyss with his grandiose, delusional failures.

There is no better way to kill industry, let alone the public, than with obscene hydro rates. Similarly, in a climate critically dependent on hydrocarbons for heat and transportation, to impose so-called carbon taxes is criminal.

In 2014 again in his own backyard in Argentina he laicized Jose Mercau who was convicted and pled guilty to sex abuse charges. 

He has also done the same actions when it comes to bishops and cardinals such as defrocking in 2013 Luis Bambaren who was the former head of Perus Conference of Catholic Bishops and just recently his removal of Cardinal Mueller as the Vatican's doctrine chief which is significant because it was Mueller as head of the CDF who stonewalled a lot of the abuse commissions proposals.

You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe.

After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire.
If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia.
Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it.

Another example someone joins the communist party, lives as a capitalist and dislikes communism but refuses to dissociate himself as a communist despite his disdain for the ideology.

A guy gets a job with British petroleum or shell, decides he cares about the environment

The institution of slavery and its consequences form the line of discrimination.""

"Puberty blockers are not ""irreversible."" Kids take them under medical supervision and if the kids decide they're not TG, they just stop taking them and puberty proceeds.

-First Law: Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.
-Second Law: The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
-Third (and Golden) Law: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
-Fourth Law: Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.
-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
-Corollary to the 5th Law: A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.

2) Throw you in prison.
3) Deport your entire family to North Korea, except for your dog.
4) Let Justin Trudeau adopt your dog and rename him Justin Jr.

If we achieved a majority, then we could just point at the referendum and strip you of all freedom.

In reality, these guys can likely infiltrate every level of our digital infrastructure at will -
So really, those supporting Trump, are you not outraged or at least moderately  concerned that any part of the ""OUR"" election was  influenced by the Russians(foreigners) and at least not curious why? Then the enemy's job is even easier!.  And what makes you believe they don't have a pile of dirt on the Donald? It's basic KGB spy 101, to have your adversary in a compromising position!  If you are dumb enough to think the RNC's geek squad stopped them, you were dumb enough to have voted for Trump.
and btw, Wikileaks isn't exactly the 21 century version of Radio Free America!",1,toxic

"Those countries are sinkholes of crap.
We have our own problems. Stop looking outward!!!
Fix your neighborhoods first!!
You globalists lay waste everywhere you go.
You stick your noses into everyone's business and get your heads shot off. Then you use up valuable local resources to feed your monstrous self righteous egos that you are saving a world that can''t be saved.
Stop moving, slow down, focus in your neighborhood.

"And you can tout Minshall’s “word-smithing” skills as another reason for IBS.

Like rain in August, you can also count on Alaska’s self-appointed, professionally aggrieved malcontent to chime in on a comment like yours.  His “free” contribution typically begins with a personal insult or some other derogatory comment in regards to your intelligence.
 
He then follows up by spraying the commenter (and anyone else who happens to read his written bescumber) with his 10 cents worth of Calcutta splutter blended with a revisionist quasi-history lecture in an attempt to frame a tragedy as just another example of Christian hatred towards the oppressed and thoroughly mistreated, innocent, peaceful muslims trapped in the perpetual cross hairs of bigotry by the evil melanastically challenged islamaphobes. 

He his is own best example and a platinum member of the “old hatreds die hard” club.",1,toxic

"There are so many things wrong with this. 1) If the kid had learned from his parents that slavery might be re-instituted, he would have gone to school with that belief, not come home with it; 2) children who are born in this country are U.S. citizens--they have broken no laws; 3) it is not up to Obama to end racism--it is up to the racists; blaming black people for the way white people treat them is entirely racist (I know, you don't use the n-word, so you can't be racist; after all you voted for a black man; but then when people wouldn't stop referring to him and his wife as ""apes,"" you didn't blame them, you blamed him); 4) if you ""have given up on hope,"" then clearly your vote for Trump is not because you hope he will end racism, end poverty, end partisanship. You voted Trump to screw everyone else in your pathetic life. With your vote, you have done absolutely zero to constructively improve the world.  You have voted to support a con man, a religious bigot, a sexual predator.",1,toxic

I used to think it was silly when I saw parents putting their children on a leash. That was until my son tried to dart into a lake. It was the best decision I could have made! It's unfortunate that anyone would verbally abuse a parent for trying to make sure their child was safe. I guess you are damned if you do and damned if you don't",1,toxic

It's always the doctors (like the teachers and public servants) who go militant when you try to crimp their cushy pay and lifestyle and undermine what little respect is left for their profession. Greed and entitlement is all this is. Ask any one of them to justify what they do for the avg $400K a year that a smidgen of intelligence and google can't do. What accountability do they have for the salary they draw and how can they justify tax breaks for them and not the rest of taxpayers? They get paid even when they kill their patients right? I don't recall hearing there is a need to do a good job to get paid. Sad state of medicine in Canada. Just another group of lazy entitled greedy unioners.,1,toxic
